<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

For snowboarders, we always hope to know some data about ski resorts, such as the amount of snowfall, the opening date, the ticket prices.
For our convenience, I created a chatbot named **`SkiBot`** for querying those data with user messages in real-time. As you can see as follows:

Here's the functionality that SkiBot has:
* Query the real-time forecast weather data in a particular ski resort on a particular date. The forecast data supports the future five days from now on. The weather feature includes:
   * ```
         * weather - (desciption)
         * snowfall - (inch)
         * rainfall - (inch)
         * visibility - (mile)
         * Humidity Level - (%)
         * Temperature - (F)
         * Wind Speed - (mph)
      ```
* Quering the real-time operating data in a particular ski resort. The operating feature includes: 
   * ```
         * status - (currently open / closed)
         * open date - (open date)
         * close date - (closed date)
         * number of lifts - (number of lifts)
         * ticket price - (including adult, youth and child prices)
         * rating - (the rating of the resort)
         * location
     ```
